TouhouOML
==============

Convert Touhou soundtracks from MediaWiki to machine-readable TOML data.

See write-up (in Chinese): https://thwiki.cc/%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7Wiki:NicoNicoNii

TODO
------

1. Implement another parser for English descriptions from TouhouWiki.net.
2. "category" extractor is still buggy.
3. Track soundtrack relationships using the "Work-Recording" hierarchy.
4. The code is of extremely low quality, need a full rewrite, it's the
   worst program I've ever written.
5. Trialing newline handling is inconsistent.
